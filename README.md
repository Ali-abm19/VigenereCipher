There are two ways to use the program, first:
 
just run the main method from the source code and follow the instructions prompted by the system.
Your input will be saved by the Scanner.

here are some example inputs:
first line is to choose Encryption or Decryption, number 1 is for Encryption while number 2 is for Decryption
the second line in Encryption is for locating your file
the third line is to choose where to save the file

as for Decryption:
the second line is for choosing the .dec file and locating it.
the third line is for the key used in Encryption.
**note that the Decrypted file is saved with program files

The second way to use the program is running the JAR file and using the interface. However, there are
some issues with the program, so if you want to use it, you will have to restart the application between
excutions, do not (Encrypt, Decrypt) in the same window, instead, (Encrypt, restart, Decrypt) same goes for
(Encrypt, Encrypt) or (Decrypt, Decrypt) you must restart the JAR between each excution.
